<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fluid Viscous Dampers(FVD) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Linear Type</li><li>Non-linear Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fluid Viscous Dampers (FVDs) are devices used to dissipate energy from vibrations or shocks in structures, enhancing stability and safety. The market for FVDs is categorized into two main types: linear and non-linear. Linear type dampers provide a constant damping force proportional to the velocity of movement, ensuring predictable responses. In contrast, non-linear type dampers offer varying damping forces depending on the velocity and displacement, allowing for more adaptable performance under different loading conditions. Both types contribute significantly to structural resilience.</p></p>
