<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Duct Air Filters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pleated Filter</li><li>Flat Filter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The duct air filters market consists primarily of two types: pleated filters and flat filters. Pleated filters have multiple folds, increasing surface area for capturing airborne particles and providing enhanced filtration efficiency, making them suitable for residential and commercial use. Flat filters, on the other hand, are simpler in design and generally less effective at trapping small contaminants, but they are often more affordable and easy to replace. Both types play crucial roles in maintaining air quality in HVAC systems.</p></p>
